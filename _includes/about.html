  I am a software developer and team lead in Booking.com.
  I have special interests in user-centered design and creating technology that is easy to use.
  Before joining Booking.com, I was a researcher in University of Glasgow and Lancaster University in the UK.
  I have a PhD in Computer Science with a specialisation in understanding users' needs.
  My research interests are in the cross section of Computer Science, Mobile Computing, Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, and Security and Authentication.
  I have collaborated with researchers to investigate topics of <em>pairing mobile devices</em>, <em>eye tracking</em>, <em>touch and gestural user interaction</em>, and <em>interventions for work-life balance</em>.
