  <h3> My Philosophy </h3>
</div>
<div class="about_details">
  I believe in <strong>simplicity</strong>, "<strong><span class="tooltip">less is more<span class="tooltiptext">a.k.a. minimalism</span></span></strong>", and “<strong>everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler</strong>”.
  Also, no matter how sophisticated a concept is, if it is not solving a problem, it is unuseful.
</div>
<div class="about_details">
  My philosophy is <strong>users first</strong> and <strong>decisions should never be made based on assumptions</strong>.
  I deplore micromanagement. Team members should be able to think freely. Everyone in a team has an equal voice.
</div>
<div class="about_details">
  I appreciate constructive criticisms. I welcome everyone to challenge my ideas, believes, and decisions.
</div>
<div class="about_details">
  I mentor by guiding and challenging people to ponder differently and think <span id="about_link"><a><span class="tooltip">outside the box<span class="tooltiptext">why does it have to be a box?</span></span></a></span>.
  We are all familiar with the old saying of "<em>Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.</em>"
  I believe we should push it a step further.
  Perhaps, the person should think about using different tools to get more fish.
  So, guide a man to think of fishing differently, and you feed him, his family, and his village, for as long as they like fish.
</div>
<div class="about_details">
  New ideas start with breaking free from conventional thinking.

  <h3> My Brief History </h3>
</div>
<div class="about_details">
  I spent a few years in the Netherlands.
  I was working as a team lead and a backend software engineer in Booking.com.
  I have years of experience of building APIs (RESTful services) and optimising system architecture for high volume of traffic.
  In Booking.com, I was part of the team (which I also led) that implemented and successfully launched <span id="about_link"><a href="https://news.booking.com/bookingcom-launches-new-content-api-for--accommodations-channel-managers-and-content-providers/" target="_blank">Content API</a></span>.
  The API is a direct channel for content managers to build and maintain properties on Booking.com via HTTP calls.
  The team also refactored a huge monolith into smaller modules for migration to microservices.
</div>
<div class="about_details">
  In Booking.com, I also implemented the
  <span id="about_link">
    <a href="/assets/pic/brotli.png" data-lightbox="brotli" data-title="When a Booking.com's webpage responds with a header of 'Content-Encoding: br', the brotli compression feature is enabled for that page.">Brotli compression feature for Booking.com's frontend web traffic</a>
  </span>.
  Results of the A/B tests showed that the feature is over 10% more data efficient than gzip. The improved compression enables quicker delivery of Booking.com's web content to end users.

<div class="about_details">
  I have special interests in user-centered design and creating technology that is easy to use.
  Prior to working in the industry, I was an academic researcher in <span id="about_link"><a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/" target="_blank">University of Glasgow</a></span> and <span id="about_link"><a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/" target="_blank">Lancaster University</a></span> in the UK.
  I have a

  with a specialisation in understanding users' needs.
  My research interests are in Computer Science, specfically in the cross section of <em>Mobile Computing</em>, <em>Human-Computer Interaction</em>, <em>Ubiquitous Computing</em>, and <em>Usable Security</em>.
  I also collaborated with researchers to investigate topics of <strong>connecting wireless devices</strong>, <strong>gaze, touch, and gestural interaction</strong>, and <strong>interventions for work-life balance</strong>.
